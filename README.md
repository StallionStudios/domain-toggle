# Domain Toggle Extension

Domain Toggle is a simple Chrome extension I created for fun and personal use. Its purpose is to make it easier for me to toggle between remote server URLs (e.g., `.com`) and local development server URLs (e.g., `.local`) with a single click.

This extension was born out of my own workflow needs and probably won't be particularly useful for anyone else â€” but that's okay! It's a small project I built for myself to learn and have fun.

## Features

- **URL Toggle**: Switch between .com and .local domains in the active browser tab.
- **Protocol Adjustment**: Automatically changes between https:// and http:// to match the domain type.
- **Lightweight**: No unnecessary features â€” it does exactly one thing.
- **For Me, By Me**: Highly specific to my development workflow needs, and probably not useful for the majority of people.

## Installation

This extension is not published on the Chrome Web Store (because, again, it's just for me), but you can load it as an unpacked extension if you're curious.

### Steps to Install:

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/server-toggle-extension.git
cd server-toggle-extension
```

2. Run the build script to generate the dist folder:

```bash
bun run build
```

3. Open the Chrome Extensions page by navigating to:
   `chrome://extensions/`
4. Enable Developer Mode (toggle in the top-right corner).
5. Click Load unpacked and select the `dist` folder generated by the build script.

### Usage

1. Open a browser tab with a `.com` or `.local` URL.
2. Click on the Server Toggle extension icon in the browser toolbar.
3. The URL in the current tab will toggle between `.com` and `.local`, adjusting the protocol (`https://` or `http://`) as needed.

### Why Did I Make This?

- Fun: I enjoy building tools for myself, even if they're not practical for others.
- Learning: This project helped me get hands-on experience with Chrome Extensions.
- Convenience: I toggle between local and remote servers frequently during development, and this saves me a few clicks.
